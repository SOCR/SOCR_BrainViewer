Overview
========

This is a lightweight 3D anatomical bio-structure viewer written purely in HTML5 + JavaScript. The [BrainViewer](https://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/BrainViewer/) uses WebGL and is supported on most modern web browsers, e.g., Chrome 16+, Firefox 15+.

Code
=========

The code is organized in the following self-explanatory directories -- [css](), [data](), [gfx](), [js]() -- and the main file launching the app in the browser s [index.html]().
The entire package can be downloaded as a [self-contained ZIP file](). Additional test datasets are available on the [DSPA website](https://dspa2.predictive.space/).
